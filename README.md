# Smart energy monitoring application

This application is built for following purpose,

•	Real time energy monitor

•	Monitor current ,voltage and power for appliances

•	Displays entire power (i.e. voltage, current) 

•	Avoid data loss during power cut 

•	Records are synchronized to an EEPROM chip/SD card mounted to the
  microcontroller board. 
  
•	Power consumption is monitored and Stored as data logs 

•	Data can be imported over Wi-Fi network/4G into MS Excel

### The features available in this application:

	Selection of different Departments

	Viewing of real-time data and the exact amount of energy consumed

	Set schedule of time even for a year

	View the consumed energy in form of bar charts including the amount to be paid 

	Set minimum and maximam power consumption to avoid damage of devices

After installing the application into mobile , connect it with the IOT board and follow the below steps
