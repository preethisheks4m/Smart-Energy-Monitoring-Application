# Smart energy monitoring application

This application is built for following purpose,

•	Real time energy monitor
•	Monitor current ,voltage and power for appliances
•	Displays entire power (i.e. voltage, current) 
•	Avoid data loss during power cut 
•	Records are synchronized to an EEPROM chip/SD card mounted to the
  microcontroller board. 
•	Power consumption is monitored and Stored as data logs 
•	Data can be imported over Wi-Fi network/4G into MS Excel
